### Problem We Are Solving

Many people around the world face challenges when it comes to using digital payment systems. These challenges are often due to:
- Language barriers: Payment platforms are typically designed with one or a few languages in mind, making it difficult for non-native speakers.
- Complexity: Many payment platforms require users to understand technical terms or follow complicated processes.
- Accessibility: People without technical expertise often find it difficult to make transactions or navigate through financial systems.

Native Pay addresses these issues by allowing users to interact with the system in their own language. The AI translates their instructions into a transaction payload, making the process smooth and intuitive. All the user has to do is confirm the payment.
